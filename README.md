## 🎯 About This Project

This is my first React project! As someone with zero React experience, I built this playground to learn how React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS work together to create interactive web applications. 

The project started as a learning exercise and evolved into a fun collection of games featuring Vipo, a robot mascot created using Nano Banana 🍌, Gemini AI.
